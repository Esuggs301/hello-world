# hello-world
Bursting at the seams to get my feet wet
Im new to developing/CS. Im learning anything and everything
I can everywhere i can. Im taking app courses like mimo,
Enki/, solo, im looking into bootcamps, and i listen to 
Podcasts while im working at my current job. I write down
just about new word or idea i come across to explore later.
Github was one of the terms ive heard tossed about frequently.
So far i have been learning html/CSS. Im excited to learn 
So much more and start down my new path in life! If you 
Stumble across my "hello-world" please feel free to say hi 
And give me ideas on new things i should check out!
